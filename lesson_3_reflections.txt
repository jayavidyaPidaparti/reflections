When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local when I would like to share my work with 
other team members, so that they can view my content in the files and make any changes if needed or add something new.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

We might want to always pull changes manually, so that any changes made in the remote by others can also be updated in the local repository.
